This was a failed experiment to build a livecd image in an automated fashion for my personal use.

In the end, I was unable to get the feedback loop fast enough to develop the image. Instead, next I will try an Ansible solution and build some automation to make sure that it still works on a schedule. I hope that this will have the same effect of building a controlled system managed by code, but with a better feedback loop.

```
# dev-desktop

Config to automate the creation of a dev-desktop image for laptops & desktops
```
